And what is Jnana? That which\\nmakes you cross this sea of flux, this samsara.\\nOf course, it is of two kinds. The first is objective knowledge\\n(Vishaya Jnana) and the second, integral knowledge, or\\nAbheda Jnana.\\nThe first type is knowledge of the world. The second\\nis the knowledge of the identity of Brahman and the individual\\nAtma, which is called Abheda or undifferentiated or integral\\nJnana. This Jnana is not a function of the intellect or Buddhi.\\nIt is a feature of something beyond it, something which\\nwitnesses the activities of even the Buddhi. It destroys the\\ndelusion about this constant flux, mistaken to be a reality. It\\nremoves fear from the heart of man. It reveals to him the\\nBrahman which he and all this is. So it is called the Right\\nJnana or Samyak Jnana, the Sameepa Jnana or the Nearest\\nJnana.\\nThere are two paths by which man can approach this\\n\\nGeetha Vahini 139 140 Geetha Vahini\\nThe Sadhakas in the midst of their efforts sometimes\\nimagine God to be less glorious than He really is! They feel\\nthat the Lord differentiates between sinners and saints, good\\nand bad, jnanis and ajnanis. These are unsound inferences.\\nThe Lord does not separate men thus. If He really did so,\\nno sinner can survive His anger on earth for even a minute.\\nAll are living on the earth, since the Lord has no such\\ndistinction. This truth is known only to the Jnani. Others are\\nunaware of this. They suffer under the false belief that the\\nLord is somewhere far, far away from them.\\nThe Jnani is free from Maya. He is unaffected by the\\nGunas: Rajas, Thamas or even Sathwa. The Jijnasu, the\\nseeker of Knowledge, however is different. He uses his time\\nfor unbroken contemplation of the Divine, in pious deeds\\nand holy thoughts. The other two, the Artha-arthi and the\\nAartha, they gather elevating experience and ruminate over\\n\\nduties which are free from the taints of Vasanas (tendencies\\nand impulses) that tie him to the relentless wheel of birth\\nand death.\\nReally speaking, man has come into this Karmakshetra\\n(Field of Activity) only to engage himself in activity, not in\\norder to earn the fruit of such activity. That is the teaching\\nof the Geetha, its fundamental lesson. The Geetha is the\\nquintessence of the meaning of all the Vedas, Yajnas and\\nYagas (offerings for the glory of God). The outward-directed\\nactivities are mentioned in the preliminary portions of the\\nVedas. Activities of the mind, like the Upasanas, which are\\ndirected inward are mentioned later. Jnana Yoga  too is\\nexpounded to minds thus clarified and purified.\\nWhoever the individual, however scholarly, he cannot\\nescape delusion and so he is subjected to grief, which acts\\nas a brake upon activity.

It destroys the\\ndelusion about this constant flux, mistaken to be a reality. It\\nremoves fear from the heart of man. It reveals to him the\\nBrahman which he and all this is.
