{"id": 1, "question": "What do the terms Niraakaara, Para, and Parabrahmamreveal about the nature of the Eternal, and how does this contrast with physical identification?", "passage": "While uneducated, the uninitiated, the person who has not taught himself the first steps of Sadhana feels he is one with his physical frame. Sath Chith Ananda\u2014the expression indicates the Eternal. Niraakaara means without Aakaara or Form. What form can we posit of the All-pervasive, the All-inclusive? \"Para\" or \"Param\" means super, beyond, above, more glorious than all. Parabrahmam indicates the One beyond and behind everything, grander than anything in the three worlds. It is non-dual, unique, the eternal and infinite. \"Two\" means difference, dissension, inevitable discord.", "gen_answer": "According to the passage, the terms Niraakaara, Para, and Parabrahmam reveal the following about the nature of the Eternal:\n\n* Niraakaara indicates the Eternal as being without form or shape (Aakaara), suggesting that it is not bound by physical limitations.\n* Para means \"super\", \"beyond\", \"above"}
{"id": 2, "question": "How does understanding the etymological roots of Brahmam and Purusha deepen one\u2019s insight into the all-pervasiveness of the Self?", "passage": "Since Brahmam is all-pervasive, It is One and only One. It is Indivisible and Indestructible. Realising this is \"Jnanam,\" the \"Highest Wisdom.\" The word Brahmam is derived from the root brh, meaning to expand, to increase, to enlarge. Brhath means big, enlarge, gross, high. Purusha has its root pri, meaning to fill, to complete. Pur means a town \"full\" of inhabitants, that is to say, the body, in a figurative manner of speaking. He who completes or is immanent in or who fills it, is the Purusha.", "gen_answer": "What a fascinating passage! Let's dive into the question.\n\nUnderstanding the etymological roots of Brahmam and Purusha can deepen one's insight into the all-pervasiveness of the Self in several ways:\n\n1. **Expansion and Enlargement**: The root \"brh\" in Brahmam implies expansion, increase, and enlargement"}
{"id": 3, "question": "How do the roots and meanings of Atma, Sath, Chith, and Ananda define the essential nature of Brahmam?", "passage": "The word Atma has, as its root, aap, meaning to acquire, to earn, to conquer, to overcome. He who knows the Atma can earn all knowledge, has acquired everything, has earned the knowledge of everything because the Atma is omnipresent. He is then fixed in Sath-Chith-Ananda; that is, in the embodiment of Brahmam. Sath is the essence of Santham(equanimity), Chith is the essence of Jnanam (wisdom); these and Ananda (bliss) together form the Swaroopa of Brahmam, or the embodiment of Brahmam. The Taittiriya Upanishad has declared, \u201cThrough Ananda, all this is born.\u201d", "gen_answer": "According to the passage, the roots and meanings of Atma, Sath, Chith, and Ananda define the essential nature of Brahmam as follows:\n\n* Atma, rooted in \"aap\" meaning to acquire, earn, conquer, or overcome, is omnipresent and represents the embodiment of Brahmam. This implies that Bra"}
{"id": 4, "question": "Why is Anandaconsidered the foundation of both Brahmam and Anthar-Atma, and how does it relate to the idea of Bhoomaa as limitless?", "passage": "Through Ananda all this is living. In Ananda alone all this is merged. In Ananda all this rests. Like the category Brahmam, the category Anthar-Atma also is possessed of the same attributes. It is also Ananda-born, Ananda-full and Ananda-merged. The more the Jnana, the more the awareness of the Ananda. The Jnani has Joy as his right hand, helpful in all emergencies and always willing and able to come to his rescue. Bhoomaa means \"limitless.\" The Chandogya Upanishad declares that Ananda inheres only in the Bhooma, the Eternal, the Brahmam.", "gen_answer": "According to the passage, Ananda is considered the foundation of both Brahmam and Anthar-Atma because it possesses the same attributes as these categories. Ananda is described as the state where all is merged, rested, and living, which is similar to the description of Brahmam. Anthar-Atma, which means \"inner"}
{"id": 5, "question": "What do terms like Jyothiswarupa and Santhiswarupa reveal about the inner nature of Paramatma, and how is it described in the Sruthi texts?", "passage": "Again, another word used by Jnanis to describe their experience of Brahmam is Jyothiswarupa, meaning, \"whose nature is splendour, glory or effulgence, who is Illumination itself.\" Ten million suns cannot equal the Splendour of the Paramatma. The word Santhiswarupa indicates that It is Santhi Itself. In Sruthi texts like Ayam Aatma Saantho, it is proclaimed that Paramatma is Prasanthi Itself. This is the reason why Paramatma is characterised as eternally pure, eternally intelligent, eternally liberated, eternally illumined, eternally content, eternally conscious. It is Wisdom Itself and so, it is the embodiment of all teaching.", "gen_answer": "According to the passage, terms like Jyothiswarupa and Santhiswarupa reveal that the inner nature of Paramatma is one of splendor, glory, effulgence, illumination, and peace.

{"id": 6, "question": "How does Vijnanadiffer from ordinary Jnana, and what transformative effect does experiencing Brahmam directly have on the seeker?", "passage": "It is not attached to anything and so, it is ever free. When the Brahmam is tasted, that very moment all hunger ceases, all desires come to an end and so it grants contentment. Vijnana is the name given to the actual experience of the Brahmam. It is a special type of Jnana, unlike the common fund of information got from the study of books. The net result of the study of any branch of learning, the fruit of all that study is also sometimes referred to as Vijnana.", "gen_answer": "According to the passage, Vijnana differs from ordinary Jnana (knowledge or understanding) in that it is a direct, personal experience of the Brahmam, whereas ordinary Jnana is gained through the study of books or other external sources. Vijnana is a special type of Jnana that is not just intellectual understanding, but"}
{"id": 7, "question": "What is the meaning of Chaithanya and Nithya Chaithanya, and how does Atma Jnana reveal the unity between the self and all beings?", "passage": "The unique Jnana of the Brahmam is known by a variety of names, like Jnana, Vijnana, Prajnana (supreme wisdom), Chith (full knowledge), Chaithanya, etc. Chaithanya means Pure Consciousness. Its opposite is the Unconscious or the Jada, the Inert. The Atma Jnana makes everything Conscious, Active. Brahmam is eternally Conscious, Nithya Chaithanya. A Jnani will feel that the Atma immanent in everyone is his own Atma. He will be happy that he is himself all this.", "gen_answer": "According to the passage, Chaithanya refers to \"Pure Consciousness\" and Nithya Chaithanya means \"Eternal Consciousness\" or \"Brahmam's eternal Consciousness\". In other words, Chaithanya is the state of being fully aware and conscious, and Nithya Chaithanya is the eternal and unchanging nature"}
{"id": 8, "question": "How does the realization of Atma as Nishkala, Nirmala, and Nishkriya lead to an experience of oneness that transcends physical and social differences?", "passage": "He will see no distinction between man and man, for he can experience only unity, not diversity, the physical differences of colour, caste, and creed, which adhere only to the body. These are but the marks of the external body. The Atma is Nishkala, that is to say, it has no parts. It is Nirmala, blemishless, unaffected by desire, anger, greed, affection, pride and envy. It is Nishkriya, activity-less. It is Prakrithi (the sensory world) that undergoes all these modifications or at least gives the impression that it is so modified.", "gen_answer": "According to the passage, the realization of Atma as Nishkala (having no parts), Nirmala (blemishless), and Nishkriya (activity-less) leads to an experience of oneness that transcends physical and social differences because the physical differences of color, caste, and creed, which adhere only to the body"}
{"id": 9, "question": "What is the relationship between attachment, desire and Moksha?", "passage": "Through attachments and affection, and even envy and hatred, one plunges into activity and gets immersed in the world. This leads to embodiment in the physical frame and further egoism. In order to become free from the twin pulls of pleasure and pain, one must rid oneself of the body-consciousness, and keep clear of self-centred actions. This again involves the absence of attachment and hatred. Desire is the number one enemy of Liberation, or Moksha. Desire binds one to the wheel of birth and death. It brings about endless worry and tribulations.", "gen_answer": "According to the passage, attachment and desire are the enemies of Moksha (Liberation). The passage states that \"Desire is the number one enemy of Liberation, or Moksha.\" This suggests that attachment and desire are obstacles that prevent one from achieving Moksha, which is freedom from the cycle of birth and death.\n\nThe passage"}
{"id": 10, "question": "What stage does Jivamuktha reach and how does he reach that stage?", "passage": "He has achieved it by dwelling on the Mithya (unreality) of theworld and contemplating its failings and faults. By thismeans, he has developed an insight into the nature ofpleasure and pain and an equanimity in both. He knows that wealth, worldly joy and pleasure are all worthlessand even poisonous. He takes praise, blame and evenblows with a calm assurance, unaffected by both honourand dishonour. Of course, the Jivamuktha reached that stage only after long years of systematic discipline and unflagging zeal when distress and doubt assailed him. Defeat only made him more rigorous in self-examination and more earnest about following the prescribed discipline.", "gen_answer": "According to the passage, Jivamuktha reaches the stage where he has developed an insight into the nature of pleasure and pain and an equanimity in both.

{"id": 11, "question": "What are Vasanas and what role do they play in the path of Atma Jnana?", "passage": "The mind must be attuned to the contemplation of Brahmam. One must strive to tread the path of Brahmam, and live in Brahmam, with Brahmam. Atma Jnana can be attained only through the threefold path of giving up vasanas, uprooting the mind, and analyzing experience to grasp reality. Without these, the knowledge of the Atma will not dawn. Vasanas - instincts and impulses - push the mind toward the sensory world and bind the individual to joy and sorrow. Therefore, vasanas must be subdued.", "gen_answer": "According to the passage, Vasanas refer to instincts and impulses. These Vasanas play a significant role in the path of Atma Jnana, as they push the mind towards the sensory world and bind the individual to joy and sorrow.

{"id": 12, "question": "How are the Jnani, intoxicant and the Atma related?", "passage": "When one takes in an intoxicant, one is not aware of pain, is it not? How does this happen? The mind is then detached from the body and so, it is not bothered by physical pain or discomfort. Similarly, the Jnani too has immersed his mind in the Atma. He can establish mental peace and quiet, by disciplining themind. The Jnani gets full Bliss from his own Atma. He does not seek it anywhere outside himself. In fact, he will have no desire or plan to find joy in anything external. He is satisfied with the inner joy he gets.", "gen_answer": "According to the passage, the Jnani, intoxicant, and Atma are related in the sense that they all enable a detachment from the physical body and its sensations, including pain.\n\n* The intoxicant allows one to become unaware of physical pain, as the mind is detached from the body.\n* The Jnani (a person who has"}
{"id": 13, "question": "What is the knowledge that mind must attain and what stands in the way of that knowledge?", "passage": "The mind rendered impure by Rajas and Thamas, by anger and conceit, by the im- pressions of a thousand attachments and desires, can be made bright and resplendent if it is put into the crucible of Inquiry and heated on the coals of Discrimination. That brightness is the light of realisation, of the knowledge that You are the Atma. Like the loo that covers everything with dust, the desires, attachments, thirsts and cravings all blacken the mind. They have to be kept away, in order that the splendour of the Self might merge in the splendour of the Overself, the Paramatma.", "gen_answer": "According to the passage, the knowledge that the mind must attain is the realization of the Self, that \"You are the Atma\".

{"id": 14, "question": "Why does Man arise and how does he become a wise one?", "passage": "Man did not arise merely to wallow in casual joy and fleeting happiness. It is insane to believe so. Identifying oneself with the \u201cI\u201d and getting attached to \u201cMine\u201d\u2014that is the root cause of sorrow and ignorance. Where there is no egoism, there will be no cognizance of the external world. When the external world is not cognized, the ego cannot exist. The wise one, therefore, will disidentify himself from the world and behave ever as the Agent of the Lord, being in it but not of it. Once, in the midst of conversation, Vasishta spoke thus to Rama: \u201cListen, O Rama, the Valiant!", "gen_answer": "According to the passage, Man does not arise simply to experience casual joy and fleeting happiness.

{"id": 15, "question": "What are the roles of viveka and vichara in attaining vijnana and ultimately realizing the Atma?", "passage": "Through Viveka (discrimination) and Vichara (in-quiry), one achieves Vijnana (higher wisdom) andthrough Vijnana, one is able to grasp the Truth, to realisethe Atma, to know the Atma. That is the ultimate goal ofall Life, the stage that is beyond the Past, Present and Future. But one point has to be clearly noted and remem- bered always: mere giving up external activitiesconnected with the satisfaction of sensory desires is not enough. The internal cravings have to be uprooted. The word Thrishna covers both these, the internal promptings and the external proceedings. When all promptings cease, it is called Muktha-thrishna .", "gen_answer": "According to the passage, the roles of Viveka (discrimination) and Vichara (inquiry) are:\n\n1.

{"id": 17, "question": "What distinguishes Purusha, the eternal Witness, from the ever-changing elements like body and mind, and why are these considered only relatively real?", "passage": "The Purusha is but the eternal Witness, the Ever-inactive, the Modification-less. Of what can you say, This is Truth? Only of that which persists in the past, the present, and the future, which has neither beginning nor end, which does not move or change, which has uniform form, unified experience giving property. The body, senses, mind, life-force - all these move and change, begin and end. They are inert (Jada), possess the three gunas - Thamas, Rajas, and Sathwa. They lack fundamental Reality and cause delusion. They have only relative value.", "gen_answer": "According to the passage, what distinguishes Purusha, the eternal Witness, from the ever-changing elements like body and mind is that Purusha is eternal, modification-less, and has neither beginning nor end.

{"id": 18, "question": "Why is Absolute Truth said to be Aparichchinna and Anirdesyam, and what does this imply about the limitations of intellectual or verbal description?", "passage": "They have no absolute value. They shine out of borrowed light only. Absolute Truth is beyond Time and Space; it is Aparichchinna (indivisible). It does not begin, it is always and ever existent: the basis, the fundamental, the self-revealing. Knowing and experiencing it is Jnanam.

Brahmam can never be grasped through elemental or physical means; though through Brahmam the eye sees, it cannot perceive Brahmam itself. The mind is limited by time, space, and causation. How can Paramatman, who is superior and unaffected by these, be limited by them?", "gen_answer": "According to the passage, the mind is limited by time, space, and causation.

A-chinthya (incapable of being conceived), Avyavahaarya (beyond action, relation) are applied to Brahmam. It is unique, with no movement toward or away from anything else.

Those who are badly ill, is it not? So too, those who are groping in Ajnana are first entitled to the teaching and training leading to the acquisition of Jnana. Why feed those who have no hunger? Why drug those who are not sick? Brahmam or Jnana is the drug for the de-realisation of the falsely realised, the removal of the fog of misunderstanding, or Ajnana.

Or, Yajnavalkya the great Rishi impart the essential principles of Vedanthic philosophy to his wife, Maithreyi, as mentioned in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad? The Upanishad cannot be false.
