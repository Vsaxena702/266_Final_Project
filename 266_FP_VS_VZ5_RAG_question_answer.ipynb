This paradox is resolved by understanding that the body dies, not the Atma (the eternal, true, and pure self).

The passage emphasizes the importance of constant practice and discipline (Abhyasa Yoga) in training the mind to focus on the Lord and avoid distractions. It is not enough to wait until the last moment of life to seek spiritual goals, but rather one must strive for them consistently and systematically throughout one's life. The passage also suggests that it is possible to attain spiritual liberation through prayer, recitation of the Name, and other forms of devotion, but that this requires consistent effort and dedication.\n"
