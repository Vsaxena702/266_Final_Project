This is because Ananda is the ultimate goal of human existence, and it is only when one achieves this state that one can truly experience the unity with the Universal Principle and the Inner Self.\n\nAccording to the text, Ananda is the state of being free from desires, attachment, and hate, and having pure consciousness. It is the state of being one with the Eternal Atma, and not identifying with the transient and impermanent body and senses.\n\nBhoomaa, or the limitless, refers to the infinite and eternal nature of the Universal Principle"}

Jnana is described as the possession of knowledge that enables one to have knowledge of all and dispense with the knowledge of all else. It is the state of being aware of the Lord in all beings and considering the Jnani as one's own Self.\n\nVijnana, on the other hand, is not explicitly defined in the provided context.

To destroy the mind, which is a great obstacle in the path of spiritual progress, one must remove these wishes by their roots. The text suggests that the first step is to conquer Kama, the demon of desire. \n\nThe text explains that desires are objective and belong to the category of the \"seen.\" To release oneself from attachment, one must watch the working of the mind from outside it, without getting involved in it.

They are mentioned as a obstacle to the path of Atma Jnana, or self-realization.\n\nThe context does not provide a detailed explanation of Vasanas, but it implies that they are a major hindrance to the attainment of self-realization. The passage states that the Artha-arthi and the Aartha, who gather elevating experiences and ruminate over them, are still bound by Vasanas, which prevents them from achieving self-realization.\n\nIn the context of the Bhagavad Gita, Vasanas are likely referring to the residual impressions of past actions, which shape an individual's thoughts,"}
