{"id": 2, "question": "How does understanding the etymological roots of Brahmam and Purusha deepen one\u2019s insight into the all-pervasiveness of the Self?", "passage": "Since Brahmam is all-pervasive, It is One and only One. It is Indivisible and Indestructible. Realising this is \"Jnanam,\" the \"Highest Wisdom.\" The word Brahmam is derived from the root brh, meaning to expand, to increase, to enlarge. Brhath means big, enlarge, gross, high. Purusha has its root pri, meaning to fill, to complete. Pur means a town \"full\" of inhabitants, that is to say, the body, in a figurative manner of speaking.

He who knows the Atma can earn all knowledge, has acquired everything, has earned the knowledge of everything because the Atma is omnipresent. He is then fixed in Sath-Chith-Ananda; that is, in the embodiment of Brahmam. Sath is the essence of Santham(equanimity), Chith is the essence of Jnanam (wisdom); these and Ananda (bliss) together form the Swaroopa of Brahmam, or the embodiment of Brahmam.

In Ananda alone all this is merged. In Ananda all this rests. Like the category Brahmam, the category Anthar-Atma also is possessed of the same attributes. It is also Ananda-born, Ananda-full and Ananda-merged. The more the Jnana, the more the awareness of the Ananda. The Jnani has Joy as his right hand, helpful in all emergencies and always willing and able to come to his rescue.

The word Santhiswarupa indicates that It is Santhi Itself. In Sruthi texts like Ayam Aatma Saantho, it is proclaimed that Paramatma is Prasanthi Itself.

Its opposite is the Unconscious or the Jada, the Inert. The Atma Jnana makes everything Conscious, Active. Brahmam is eternally Conscious, Nithya Chaithanya.

{"id": 9, "question": "What is the relationship between attachment, desire and Moksha?", "passage": "Through attachments and affection, and even envy and hatred, one plunges into activity and gets immersed in the world. This leads to embodiment in the physical frame and further egoism. In order to become free from the twin pulls of pleasure and pain, one must rid oneself of the body-consciousness, and keep clear of self-centred actions. This again involves the absence of attachment and hatred. Desire is the number one enemy of Liberation, or Moksha. Desire binds one to the wheel of birth and death. It brings about endless worry and tribulations.", "gen_answer": "A profound question!\n\nIn Hinduism and Buddhism, attachment, desire, and Moksha (Liberation or Nirvana) are intricately connected.

{"id": 10, "question": "What stage does Jivamuktha reach and how does he reach that stage?", "passage": "He has achieved it by dwelling on the Mithya (unreality) of theworld and contemplating its failings and faults. By thismeans, he has developed an insight into the nature ofpleasure and pain and an equanimity in both. He knows that wealth, worldly joy and pleasure are all worthlessand even poisonous. He takes praise, blame and evenblows with a calm assurance, unaffected by both honourand dishonour. Of course, the Jivamuktha reached that stage only after long years of systematic discipline and unflagging zeal when distress and doubt assailed him. Defeat only made him more rigorous in self-examination and more earnest about following the prescribed discipline.", "gen_answer": "In Hinduism, particularly in the Yogic and Advaitic traditions, Jivamukta is a state of spiritual realization that is considered the highest stage of spiritual growth.\n\nA Jivamukta is someone who has achieved liberation while still alive, meaning they have realized their true nature as the ultimate reality (Brahman) and have"}
{"id": 11, "question": "What are Vasanas and what role do they play in the path of Atma Jnana?", "passage": "The mind must be attuned to the contemplation of Brahmam. One must strive to tread the path of Brahmam, and live in Brahmam, with Brahmam. Atma Jnana can be attained only through the threefold path of giving up vasanas, uprooting the mind, and analyzing experience to grasp reality. Without these, the knowledge of the Atma will not dawn.

{"id": 12, "question": "How are the Jnani, intoxicant and the Atma related?", "passage": "When one takes in an intoxicant, one is not aware of pain, is it not? How does this happen? The mind is then detached from the body and so, it is not bothered by physical pain or discomfort. Similarly, the Jnani too has immersed his mind in the Atma. He can establish mental peace and quiet, by disciplining themind. The Jnani gets full Bliss from his own Atma. He does not seek it anywhere outside himself.

That brightness is the light of realisation, of the knowledge that You are the Atma.

Identifying oneself with the \u201cI\u201d and getting attached to \u201cMine\u201d\u2014that is the root cause of sorrow and ignorance.
