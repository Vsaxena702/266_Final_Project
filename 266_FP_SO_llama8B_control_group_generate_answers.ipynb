It implies that the Supreme Bliss is the highest and ultimate state, which one does not attain or acquire, but simply is and becomes aware of. This suggests that the Supreme Bliss is a more profound and higher state than Rasa Aaswaadanam.

This suggests that the joy of liberation is a direct result of the attainment of liberation, and that it is a key aspect of the experience of liberation.

By thismeans, he has developed an insight into the nature ofpleasure and pain and an equanimity in both. He knowsthat wealth, worldly joy and pleasure are all worthlessand even poisonous. He takes praise, blame and evenblows with a calm assurance, unaffected by both honourand dishonour. Of course, the Jivamuktha reached thatstage only after long years of systematic discipline andunflagging zeal when distress and doubt assailed him.Defeat only made him more rigorous in self-examina-tion and more earnest about following the prescribeddiscipline.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"According to the passage, where can true knowledge of the Atma not be obtained?\",\n          \"What is the significance of the term \\\"Abhasa Avaranam\\\" in the context of self-realization?\",\n          \"What does the term \\\"Mithya\\\" refer to in the passage?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"generated_answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"According to the passage, true knowledge of the Atma cannot be obtained in Swarga (heaven) or in Mount Kailasa (The abode of Shiva). \\n\\nNote: The passage is discussing the concept of Atma Jnana (Awareness of the Atma) and how it can be obtained through the conquest of the mind and the scotching of the flames of desire.

In the context of self-realization, it means that a person who has not attained self-realization will mistakenly believe that Godhead is not present within themselves, whereas a self-realized person will understand that Godhead (Paramatma) exists within every Jivi (living being), even if it is not perceived or acknowledged.

It is mentioned in the passage as the means by which the Jivamuktha has achieved his goal. He has achieved it by dwelling on the Mithya of the world and contemplating its failings and faults. This implies that the Jivamuktha has come to understand that the world is not as it seems and that its apparent reality is actually an illusion.
